#  Changes need to be made to the shellinaboxd config file as the OPTS that are set by default

#  THe issue with the testing is located in appliance.py . The methodology for testing tftp and ftp was using netstat. for futur installs
 # We would either need to use ss wich comes with redhat, or install net-tools.x86_64. cmd ss -l would get the nessisary info  as well, and ERIC pointed out
 # we could symLink netstat to ss

In order to get ftp to work the curent vsftp.template.conf file is not being placed in the right area. it needs to be placed in

      /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf

as the default file in this location is read and has ipv6 enabled as the primary sockt on witch to listen for ftp.    -before pull verify

=============NOW DONE========================
shellinabox SHOULD WORK FROM INITIAL INSTALL AS THE MISSING SYSCONFIG/FILE HAS BEEN CREATED PLACED BY THE CENTOS_SETUP.YAML
SYM LINK HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE FOR NETSTAT
To seperate TS from NETWORKING named based hosting will need to be used
